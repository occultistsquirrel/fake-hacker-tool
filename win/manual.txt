------------OCULTISTSQUIRREL'S FAKE HACKING TOOL MANUAL------------

APRIL 22 2021

  I have created a windows version! It is in an exe this time instead
of a bash script. Just download it and run virus.bat. The actuall
program is in virus.exe. Virus.bat just clears the terminal and changes
the colors in cmd to black and green (like in the movies.) It askes for
a password, so type in "HACK01101" to unlock it. Get the password wrong
a couple times just for fun, but then get it right. It then opens up a
fake hacker terminal. Just type in something scary like "install.virus."
After typing a command press enter. Of course this is all fake so it
doesn't  matter what you type. After typing something and pressing enter,
It streams binary code down the screen. Press CTRL+C to stop.
