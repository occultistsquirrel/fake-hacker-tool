    This is for MAC and LINUX. Any system with bash really. If you
are on windows, you should install cygwin, which emulates a unix-like

it by typing "./hack". You can also copy it to /usr/bin, and then
just type "hack". The actual program is very simple. It looks like one

fore a password. The correct password is "HACK01101". Once you type
in this it spams the screen. To quite at any time, just press ctrl+c.
