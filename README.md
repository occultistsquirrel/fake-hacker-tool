# fake-hacker-tool

Hello. This is the fake hacking utility and it sucks. It's a poorly programmed command line
program. I originally wrote this in bash script, which is compatable with mac and linux. I
was going to make a windows batch script file, but it didn't work out. Instead I made the windows
one with C. The bash scripts are in the folder called "bash(linux&mac)," and the windows 32 bit
executables as well as the c source code are available in the folder named "win." The bash script
runs on linux, but I have not tested it on mac. It should work. The EXE runs on windows. If you
still want to try this program out, then go ahead. It really sucks.
